# Paper scripts

Scripts for reproducing the figures in the article:

Robbert L. Harms, Alard Roebroeck, bioRxiv 328427; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/328427 

## Instructions
These scripts require MDT version 0.14.2 to run. Data for the first 8 figures is included in the directory `data`. The scripts in the folder `data_collection` are meant to be run one after another to generate the results. The scripts in the directory `figures` can then be run to generate the figures.
